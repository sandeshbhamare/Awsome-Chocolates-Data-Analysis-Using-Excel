# Awsome Chocolates Data Analysis Using Excel
 Greetings to the Awesome Chocolates Data Analysis Project repository! This initiative is dedicated to delving into employee data from a chocolate company using Microsoft Excel. The dataset encompasses diverse and informative columns including Name, Gender, Age, Rating, Date Joined, Department, Salary, and Country.
 In this project, I've undertaken several crucial tasks to gain meaningful insights from the provided dataset. Here's a brief overview of the key activities:

1. Cleaning Data
I started by ensuring data integrity and quality. This involved:

Formatting tables to maintain consistency.
Conduct summary analyses to get an overall understanding.
Identifying and handling duplicate values.
Combining data from different sources to enrich our analysis.
Utilizing Power Query for append operations, streamlining data processing.
2. Business Questions
The heart of this analysis lies in answering important business questions:

Quick Analysis of Data: Swift initial insights to understand the dataset.
Information Finder: Digging deeper to uncover significant details.
Extended Information Finder: Expanding the scope to include more complex insights.
Male vs Female Comparison: Understanding gender-related patterns and differences.
Annual Bonus Calculation: Calculating and assessing annual bonuses for employees.
3. Charts and Visualizations
Visual representation enhances the understanding, and I've accomplished this with:

Analyze Salary Spread: Visualizing the distribution of employee salaries.
Relationship between Salary and Employee Ratings: Understanding if ratings correlate with salaries.
Company Growth Over Time: Tracking the company's growth trajectory.
Regional Scorecard: Evaluating performance across different countries.
